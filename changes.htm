These are the following changes that we would make to our site:
We didn't incorporate the complete list of stats of NHL as we would have hoped
that task seemed to be too much trouble either accessing a database, building one
or typing all of the info into a table. That task was too large for our first time 
designing a webstie. Instead we displayed the stats for the top 10 players and goalies
of all time. We think our layout works well and if very simple as to what our target 
audience would have wanted. Other than fixing the data we don't have any changes to
the design that we would have liked to make.
